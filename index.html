        This is a site where I host really whatever I want.
        Be it my To-Do list or a live view of the office of
        Satya Nadella, this site is whatever I want it to be
        and is a sort of hobby base for any projects I desire
        to put here.

        The Gribber will soon get its own live cam, where you can watch it
        calculate Mersenne primes for the rest of its pitiful existence.
