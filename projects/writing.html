            This is a place for me to host the crazy bananas shit I've written over the years.
            This includes poems, sales pitches, scripts, and pretty much any other project that involves writing you can
            imagine.
            Consider this a sort of blog that doesn't really say anything at all.
            This is all just text on a page.

            I honestly do not know what to write here.
            While I could probably cook up something absolutely
            crazy (I am on 4 hours of sleep and have been awake
            for 19 hours and 13 minutes as of beginning writing),
            honestly, I don't want to.
            <br><br>
            I'm currently sitting awake staring at my HP 14 Laptop (Do not ever purchase this product) scribing this
            shit
            into VSCode (The funny editor).
            <br><br>
            Honestly I feel like I should go to sleep.
            I want to go to sleep.
            Yet here I am.
            I have not rocked anybody like a hurricane.
            <br><br>
            Maybe I should put some link to an arg encoded into this text.
            Have it lead through fake people, fake bank accounts, and all lead back to nothing.
            <br><br>
            I have honestly no idea what I'm saying here.
            This actually sounds like the disjointed ramblings of a deranged lunatic right now.
            There is no goal to this text.
            This is the definition of text on a page.
            <br><br>
            Snapped,<br>
            Cracked in the moonlight.<br>
            It flung away with force.<br>
            Raking rhythms as it ran.<br>
            Far,<br>
            Down into the leaves it descended.<br>
            Simple squirrels scared at the sound.<br>
            Stop,<br>
            Tune in and listen.<br>
            The sounds of the jungle are all around.

            This is literally the second time today.
            Although now it's considered a school night and I must wake up before the sun is risen to
            boil inside that evil, evil building.
            <br><br>
            I honestly don't know how one designs a building to be evil.
            It just feels to me like the very building itself is just so corrupt.
            <br><br>
            And to be honest, I have no idea why the building feels that way to me.
            I just feel like it represents the sense of dread I feel walking into its maw.
            <br><br>
            "Just another day of mind-numbing! :D".
            <br><br>
            Why does it have to be this way?
            Does it have to be this way?
            I don't think it does.
            I've seen a million other activities that teach you how to learn, and not
            one of those has been "school".
            <br><br>
            Does nobody in positions of power see that this system is fried?
            Are they just okay with schools pumping out worthless "do-what-you're-tolds"?
            Are they okay with a population who only pathfinds?
            <br><br>
            Engineers and scientists are critical to society and advancement.
            So why the hell is it that every self-proclaimed STEAM class I've taken has only
            been the equivalent of getting hit on the head with a cartoon hammer for the entire
            time you're within the classroom.
            <br><br>
            It's not that I don't understand the material, it's that I understood it by reading the
            fucking lesson material. I don't need someone with a dry-erase marker yapping at me telling
            me things I could've learned off of reading a Wikipedia article. I want to be taught useful
            skills that will help me navigate through life and contribute to society, not scribe away endlessly
            on a piece of paper that is getting thrown into the can the moment class ends.
            <br><br>
            That is simply silly. This whole rant is simply silly. What even happened here.

            I do not know what to do on the website right now.
            I have ideas, I just don't know which to implement.
            I would like to make the website compatible with screen readers as well as make it cursor navigable.
            However, I'm not sure where to start.
            I believe in order to make it more compatible with screen readers I need to add more semantic elements
            (Headers,
            footers, nav elements, and the like).
            <br><br>
            This is absolute yapping.
            <br><br>
            I just simply have no motivation to work on anything so I'm here writing whatever this is to pass the time.

            Fear. <br>
            It grips us all, <br>
            Tearing and pulling, <br>
            Rending, <br>
            Bending, <br>
            Neverending.
            <br><br>
            It grips us all, <br>
            Forever eternal, <br>
            It will subsist long after we are bones <br>
            And it arrived at the beginning of us all.
            <br><br>
            It is unstoppable. <br>
            At least, that's what it whispers, <br>
            Its dark snake tongue licking at your ear.
            <br><br>
            But fear is a liar. <br>
            A fabricator whose base is in a lie. <br>
            There is no fear. <br>
            Only what I have of it. <br>
            And I won't have it. <br>
            Not anymore. <br>
            For I am greater than fear, <br>
            I will not let fear take my life away.
            <br><br>
            I will not let fear take my love away.
            <br><br>
            I will not let fear grip me with its tongue razor sharp for all it can throw is words. <br>
            Fear owns no stones and cannot hurt me when I turn my face to it.
            <br><br>
            Fear is nothing without me.
            <br><br>
            And I'm leaving the fucking building.
