        This is a place for me to host the crazy bananas shit I've written over the years.
        This includes poems, sales pitches, scripts, and pretty much any other project that involves writing you can
        imagine.
        Consider this a sort of blog that doesn't really say anything at all.
        This is all just text on a page.

            I honestly do not know what to write here.
            While I could probably cook up something absolutely
            crazy (I am on 4 hours of sleep and have been awake
            for 19 hours and 13 minutes as of beginning writing),
            honestly, I don't want to.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm currently sitting awake staring at my HP 14 Laptop (Do not ever purchase this product) scribing this
            shit
            into VSCode (The funny editor).
            <br>
            <br>
            Honestly I feel like I should go to sleep.
            I want to go to sleep.
            Yet here I am.
            I have not rocked anybody like a hurricane.
            <br>
            <br>
            Maybe I should put some link to an arg encoded into this text.
            Have it lead through fake people, fake bank accounts, and all lead back to nothing.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have honestly no idea what I'm saying here.
            This actually sounds like the disjointed ramblings of a deranged lunatic right now.
            There is no goal to this text.
            This is the definition of text on a page.
            <br>
            <br>
            Snapped,
            <br>
            Cracked in the moonlight.
            <br>
            It flung away with force.
            <br>
            Raking rhythms as it ran.
            <br>
            Far,
            <br>
            Down into the leaves it descended.
            <br>
            Simple squirrels scared at the sound.
            <br>
            Stop,
            <br>
            Tune in and listen.
            <br>
            The sounds of the jungle are all around.
